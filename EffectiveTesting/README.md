Demo:
Run the tests to see, you arent able to understand what the test does.
TODO 1:Rename "TestCreate" to something like "Create_FillsAllProperties".
Run the tests to show the test output doesnt show why it failed and what is difference in expected and current values of the assert.
TDD - Explain we are now first going to fix the test before we fix the code to be able trust the test.
TODO 2: Implement custom Assert method to show all values, even the test fails. The method writes all values expected/current to the console so we know everything from test output.
Fix the product so the tests passes.
TODO 3: Fix the test, so it doesnt use DateTime.Now.
